    "Summary: This dataset explores the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance and emotional regulation, based on a 2024 study conducted in the Middle East. It includes 60 participants from diverse backgrounds, capturing data on sleep duration, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, cognitive function (reaction times, memory accuracy), and emotional stability. Additionally, it records demographic factors such as age, gender, BMI, and lifestyle influences like caffeine intake, physical activity levels, and stress levels."
